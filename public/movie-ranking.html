<h1>The Best Movies According to Trinity</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time <br> </h2>
<p>Studio Ghibli Edition</p>
<hr> 

<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>This movie has beautiful images of the scenery and the nastalgia. 
<br> This movie is also very heartwarming and a great family movie.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I would rank this as my second favorite movie. Everyone knew this one was <br>
definitley going to be up here. It is a very popular movie and it is amazing <br>
it gives me a very summer, peaceful vibe, and many lessons to be learned. </p>

<h3>How's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Lastly I would say this movie. It is a good watch again with the family. I would say <br>
it does not have that same summer and peaceful feeling that you would <br>
get with the previous two movies. This movie is more of a thriller to watch. More <br>
action is added into this movie. Still child friendly and funny to watch. </p>
