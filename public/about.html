<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Trinity Sloan and I am an aspiring Junior web developer. I am currently 23 years old and living in Northern Virginia. 
  I have had a thing for computers every since middle school. I had knew I wanted to do something in tech I just wasn't sure what. I then found out about freecodecamp from
  Twitter. I completed a challenge and ever since then I was like this is exactly what I want to do. Now I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#,
  and many other important topics. I love learning new things and completing different challenges. My favorite feeling is when I don't understand why somethning 
  is not working. I'm looking and looking and finally fix it and everything clicks in my head and on the page. I feel the most accomplished feeling.
I currently am learning so I am able to apply to internships so I can learn even more. Wish me luck. Thank you for taking the time out to read this!</p>
